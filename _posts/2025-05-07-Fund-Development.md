**Hy began by stating the stakes of our work:**

Community Canvases faciliates arts-based community building.<br>
Community Canvases is an antidote to the poisonous hate, chaos and fear.<br>
Reaction is natural.<br>
Finding space to discern and respond is powerful.

**Hy concluded by offering a poem inspired by his experiences in Fund Development Bootcamp:**


Hello Fund Development Bootcamp<br>
I ask you who is the champ?<br>
Is it the material by Linda Ray?<br>
Is it the students, glued to what the instructors say?<br>
Is it the assistant instructors, engaged with us every day?

You opened my eyes to new ideas<br>
and a new confidence.<br>
I see now, we are all scaling a rock face<br>
Scrambling up, further from the base<br>
We crawl from crag to ledge<br>
Looking down, we make mistakes and might fall<br>
But looking around <br>
I see my classmates and instructors<br>
Spread along beneath the cliffs<br>
Some above and below <br>
But all of us have ropes and harnesses <br>
Some are climbing higher with pinions<br>
Showing us paths, and sharing their opinions.

Will any of us reach the top?<br>
This is immaterial.<br>
As we raise ourselves and our organizations<br>
We raise humanity<br>
We raise hope<br>
We fill our communities with an abundance of life.<br>
Bootcamp embodies that we are all in this together.

Thank you for leading us on this climb.<br>
Thank you for trusting in us.<br>
Thank you for including Community Canvases.<br>
For everyone here,<br>
Thank you for the necessary <br>
And transformative work <br>
You each do in our community.<br>
