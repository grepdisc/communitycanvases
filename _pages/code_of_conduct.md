## Community Canvases' Community Swing Code of Conduct

### Code of Conduct
Community Swing is dedicated to providing a safe, comfortable, and fun environment for all, regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation, age, appearance, disability, or religion. We will not tolerate harassment of any kind, including but not limited to offensive verbal comments, unwelcome advances, sexual advances, inappropriate physical contact, stalking, deliberate intimidation, and disruptive behavior. 

We reserve the right to take action including a verbal warning, denial of admission, asking an attendee to leave an event without a refund, banning from future events, and/or contacting authorities if necessary. We reserve the right to share information concerning specific incidents with other dance organizations. We reserve the right to ask attendees for identification. This Code of Conduct applies to organizers, instructors, students, and any attendees of Community Swing. By attending a Community Swing event, you agree to our Code of Conduct.

### Reporting a Concern
If you are harassed or observed harassment, please notify us immediately. We will deal with the situation promptly and with discretion. Community Swing organizers can be approached at any time. You may contact us by contacting organizers

### Alcohol Policy
Alcohol is served at the Ukrainian Civic Center. Please drink responsibly. We are happy to refer any individual to a taxi or rideshare service. Underage drinking or supplying alcohol to a minor will not be tolerated. We reserve the right to deny admission to anyone who is disruptively intoxicated.

### Safer Spaces
Community Swing considers all those who participate in our events to be part of our dance community. We strive to have all who attend our events feel welcome, accepted and respected.

Our intention is to create an atmosphere of fun, excitement, and safety. We expect our dancers to follow good dance etiquette and to be mindful of their surroundings. This means that their dancing does not cause anyone injury or discomfort. When dancing with a partner, be aware of your connection and avoid dangerous movements. If you accidentally make contact with someone while dancing, please ask if they are okay and apologize. Please understand that different styles of dance may have different set of partner agreements, and aesthetics may not be appropriate for some dance styles but are warranted in other dance styles (e.g., Swing verses Tango).

Feel free to ask anyone to dance. Feel free to decline a dance, with no need to offer any excuse. If you are declined, do not take it personally or press the matter. Be gracious at all times.

Attendees to Community Swing classes and events assume all risk and responsibility for injuries they may cause or suffer. Community Swing is not responsible for lost or stolen possessions.
