# *WRITE ON - Home*

*WRITE ON - Home* is a planned offering of Community Canvases'
Kind Fools’ [WRITE ON](https://kindfools.org/writeon/) intuitive 
writing workshops using the theme of “home” with communities that have
a special relationship with the concept/experience of home. These
workshops provide a supportive and creative environment for an
exploration of our individual and collective relationship with the
idea, feeling, and experience of home.

It is our hope to be able to offer these in summer/fall 2025:

- Four workshops with immigrant communities with interpreters
- Four workshops with our local homeless communities
- Four workshops welcoming both of these communities as well as our broader community

Anyone is welcome at any of these workshops, as we discover our common humanity by listening more
deeply to ourselves and each other. We will explore topics together including home, safety and
belonging. In current political rhetoric, there is a theme that some people belong more than others.
These workshops are a clear statement that everyone belongs, and an opportunity for everyone to express
their truth and creativity in a supportive and barrier-free environment.
By gathering in a fully inclusive space, where every participant feels empowered to fully belong and
to fully welcome every other participant, we model together a feeling of safety, a feeling of belonging,
and a feeling of home.

Please check back here in the coming months for more details.

Three WRITE ON workshops will be offered to each of four affinity groups for which “home” will be a common thread: immigrants and refugees with interpreters, people experiencing homelessness, seniors, and anyone.

The goal of this project is to build just relationships (and a common sense of community) among people across the city, to foster confidence in self-expression and writing, and to build paths of mutual respect and understanding. Putting the comfort and emotional safety of our participants first, we seek to discover what these writers create from their lived experience. What universal truths and commonalities arise among each group’s writings? What is unique in each person or groups’ relationship with home?

Writers will be inspired by soulful and playful poems
such as Rumi's The Guest House or the following poem
by our lead facilitator:

**How do we build our home?**

Some people build with resources and focus and planning.<br>
They dig a hole down to bedrock.<br>
They pour in concrete and when it dries,<br>
they build their walls up brick by brick.<br>
For a roof they choose something sensible<br>
like steel or tile or asphalt. 

Some people build their home out of desperation and scarcity.<br>
Digging in the sand they push up whatever supports they can.<br>
They scramble and exert enormous effort to create walls<br>
and moats and the appearance of permanence,<br>
*fighting wave after wave after wave of the rising tide.*

I choose to build my home with abundance.<br>
I lay down a piece of plywood,<br>
fastening together four more pieces of plywood<br>
and placing a fifth on top.<br>
Then, I paint my box blue,<br>
*so my home is bigger on the inside just like Doctor Who.*
