## History 

Community Canvases was founded by Jim and I after a considerable amount of research on the subject of communities and graffiti. One of the sources we found had done testing to see whether graffiti removal or graffiti replacement was the answer. Just covering it up with gray paint wasnâ€™t enough. Rather, murals were the answer. The study found that not only did murals deter graffiti on themselves, but they had a radiant effect on the area around them. Over the past decade, Community Canvases has grown to include school programs, summer camps, community-building neighborhood clean up, and writing programs.
