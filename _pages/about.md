## History 

Founded in 2013, we reduced graffiti through murals on Buffalo’s Main St. and artwork on traffic signal boxes on Hertel and Elmwood. We have worked with artists, communities, learners and leaders on over 35 murals and public art installations throughout WNY. We are an incubator for programs which are integral to our organization, and can become self-sustaining like Buffalo Community Fridge.

## Our Vision
We build communities abundant with spaces where every person feels a sense of belonging, an invitation to
express themselves, and a certainty that they are responsible for and capable of creating positive change in
their neighborhood, community and city through art and community engagement.

We pursue this mission through unique programs that inspire creativity and enhance community well-being
such as:
1. [Kind Fools](https://kindfools.org)’ intuitive writing workshop, WRITE ON, creates a welcoming space for reflection, listening
and authentic human connection. As a recent participant said, this “reminds me of what it means to
be human and what it’s like to be at peace with other human beings.”<br>
2. [WNY Trash Mob](https://www.instagram.com/wnytrashmob/)
inspires a culture of agency through neighborhood cleanups, beautification, and art
initiatives. We facilitate a sense of community while advocating for meaningful improvements to
policy and infrastructure. Since 2020, we’ve organized over 36 cleanups with local officials,
businesses, and block clubs. In 2024, our 4th annual Earth Day Cleanup Challenge distributed 400
bags and gloves to 31 teams cleaning their neighborhoods.<br>
3. [Community Swing](https://www.facebook.com/communityswing)
organizes a lesson and dance every Wednesday evening. Started in May 2021 to
reduce isolation from the pandemic and to provide work for local musicians, we foster a welcoming
and fun community through the art of dance at the Ukrainian-American Civic Center.<br>
4. Collaborative Art promotes community awareness, civic engagement, mindfulness, and artistic
principles by facilitating workshops to design and construct functional public art, such as
redecorating signal boxes with diverse local artists.

Community Canvases was founded by Jim Montour, Alex Cornwell, and Elaine Grisanti.  In Alex's words, "After a considerable amount of research on the subject of communities and graffiti. One of the sources we found had done testing to see whether graffiti removal or graffiti replacement was the answer. Just covering it up with gray paint wasn’t enough. Rather, murals were the answer. The study found that not only did murals deter graffiti on themselves, but they had a radiant effect on the area around them." Over the past decade, Elaine Grisanti has stewarded Community Canvases along with Katherine Pessecow and we have grown to include school programs, summer camps, community-building neighborhood clean ups ([fb](https://www.facebook.com/wnytrashmob/), [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/wnytrashmob/)), and [writing programs](https://kindfools.org).
