## SIGNAL BOX ART PROJECT

Applications being accepted [Apply Now](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf-nt3owVZFp9VAyQ8Bdsuz2yw8sp42zyoeywqvfMVT_ch9HA/viewform){: .btn .btn--success .btn--large}<br>

In the interest of enhancing the visual experience for
residents and visitors in the City of Buffalo and Western New
York, Community Canvases is proud to announce our Signal Box
Art Project.

This project is inviting artists to help transform
neighborhoods into visual and graphic delights that will not only
provide an entertaining and stimulating experience to the
passersby, but also offer social and well-being support. Our artful
electrical signal boxes include two QR Codes, a “help” QR code
and a “story” QR code.

The help QR code directs an individual to services available
to them near the location of the signal box. The story QR code will
direct them to a story or poem, told by a local resident that
provides inspiration. 

Community Canvases has identified 2 boxes for artistic and
informative enhancement.

The electrical Signal Box will be wrapped in a vinyl image
submitted by the artist and approved by Community Canvases
and [Niagara Metals](https://www.niagarametals.com) which sponsors this artistic endeavor.

> At Niagara Metals, we are committed to environmental sustainability, responsible recycling practices, and being actively involved in our communities. As a local scrap metal recycling company, we are essential to a greener future of less waste. We raise awareness of metal recycling and we make sure the public knows that we are ready to pay you for your recycled metal. Community members get paid as they contribute to reducing waste and preserving our precious resources. Together, we can all keep metal out of the landfill. Our community engagement efforts are focused on removing barriers to recycling and engaging individuals, businesses and organizations in working together to protect our environment.

**THE LOCATION** – for this current project, the electrical Signal
Boxes to be wrapped are at the following locations:
1. Hertel Avenue and Elmwood Avenue
2. Amherst Street and Elmwood Avenue
3. Additional locations may be added

## Artist Participation

Anyone can submit an original work of art (painting, oil, watercolor
or acrylic, graphic design, or photography) that will be applied to an
Electrical Signal Box. Invitations will be extended to anyone
willing to meet the requirements of this call for artists. A general
invitation to submit proposals is being issued to the public—both
amateur and professional artists— as well as art and educational
institutions. We would like to have the broadest possible reach in
hope of acquiring the highest level of talent and imagination for
this project.

Proposals can be inspired by but are not limited to the following
themes:
- **Renew, Recycle, Reuse**
- **Local Flora and Fauna**

The proposals should be based on the dimensions of the
enclosed “Electrical Signal Box Diagram” and should include all
sides of the Electrical Signal Box. Artistry must be 2- dimensional
in digital or paint media. Dimensions of the Box are listed on the
diagram.

Final box assignment will be determined by Community
Canvases. Proposals should include the artist’s signature on the
proposal as it would appear on the actual Electrical Signal Box.
Artists may submit proposals for one box. All submitted proposals
become the property of Community Canvases.

## *All artwork must be an original work of art by the submitting artist.*

### ELIGIBILITY
The competition is open to all artists located within the Western
NY area regardless of race, color, religion, national origin, gender,
age, military status, sexual orientation, marital status, or physical
or mental disability.

Artists who have previously been accepted and have had their
work installed will not be eligible at this time.

### Help QR Code
On each Signal Box, Community Canvases will include a Help QR
code. Upon scanning by the phone of a passerby or a person-in-
need, the phone will be directed to a website with a list of social
service information, customized based on the location of the
signal box and the types of needs that members of the local
community feel are most relevant. This QR code may link to a
directory page on [https://communitycanvases.org](
https://communitycanvases.org/resources/) or to a page on
[https://www.211wny.org/](https://www.211wny.org/)
or to a referral page for a local social service provider.

### Story QR Code
On each Signal Box, Community Canvases will include a Story
QR code. Upon scanning by the phone of a passerby, the phone
will be directed to a website with stories and poems submitted by
local writers. The story chosen can be customized by the location
of the signal box. This QR code may link to a specific story or a
collection of stories and poems at https://kindfools.org/writtenat/
which will be read by authors in the neighborhood with the Signal
Box. These stories will be collected from participants in
Community Canvases’ WRITE ON workshops. Additional WRITE
ON workshops will be conducted in these neighborhoods to
facilitate local residents expressing their truth and creating these
stories and poems.

#### Story Creation Process
Several of the collected stories and poems will be created in
Community Canvases’ WRITE ON! which is a workshop where
participants learn how to express themselves better and more
confidently over time. Each session includes a check in, a brief
guided meditation, two free-write opportunities, and an
opportunity to share your writing in a purely encouraging
environment.

### DURATION
- Wraps may be removed after 4-5 years depending on condition.
- Wraps may be removed at any time at the discretion of
Community Canvases.
