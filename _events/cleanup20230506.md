# Clean Up Massachusetts Avenue Park on May 6, 2023


Meet at Massachusetts Avenue Park at 10:45am on Saturday, May 6. Community Canvases' WNY Trash Mob and the Westside Park Block Club are organizing this cleanup with community, food, lots of local organizations providing education, and the Massachusetts Avenue Project's seedling sale going on right across the street.

Reach out to [@WNYTrashMob](https://www.instagram.com/wnytrashmob/) or [wnytrashmob@gmail.com](mailto:wnytrashmob@gmail.com) with any questions.
